Hi, my name is Solomon Kamau,

I am and always have been an outlier, I was exposed to entrepreneurship at an early age, watching my parents in Kenya, and later in America etch their way into different industries. Creating success through hard work, integrity, determination, customer service and phenomenal business acumen.

Over the past decade, I've established companies that have provided corporate and leisure ground transportation solutions, medical and wheelchair transport, ground logistics, courier services and Import-export of consumer goods.

I've had the amazing opportunity of serving some amazing brands such as: Walgreens, U.S Army, Delta Airlines, United Airlines, GoJet, Amtrak, PGA Tour, University of North Carolina(UNC), Duke University, Oxford University Press, ESPN, HBO, Schneider Electric, IBM, Red Hat, Citrix, Office Max, Courier Express, Starwood Hotels and Resorts World Wide, 21c Museum Hotels, People Fluent, Polsinelli, Worldwide Clinical Trials, Still Life, One Call Care, and C.B.R.E among many others.

Currently, my focus has switched to Africa, my homeland. I'm focusing on creating funds, co-found opportunities, projects, entities and initiatives that: invest, educate, employ, inspire, feed, and mentor my fellow African. With an interest in finding a balance and synergy within sustainability, import-export, Mining, construction/real estate, news gathering, lifestyle brands, technology, manufacturing, life sciences, data, Infrastructure, defense, mobile, and tourism/leisure sectors.

In my spare time, I'm a Gastronome, wine enthusiast, Hobby photographer and explorer.
